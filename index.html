    <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
    <p>I would say that the knowledge from previous classes definitely helped me figure out how to use the new knowledge from this class and complete assignments.</p>
    <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
    <p>Honestly, i wouldn't change anything about it. The subjects aren't that hard to understand and if you dop end up struggling with trying to understand something, the instructor is always there to help. Also, the classroom for the course is a very relaxing workspace. It doesn't feel crowded in the classroom.</p>
    <h1>Did you learn what you expected in this course?</h1>
    <p>ABSOLUTELY!</p>
    <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
    <p>I was actually familiar with all of the concepts expect for one. Bootstrapping was something I had never heard of until I took this course.</p>
